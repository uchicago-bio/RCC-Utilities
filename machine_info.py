machine_info.py

Retrieves detailed hardware topology information for the current machine, including
the number of sockets, physical cores, and logical threads.

This utility is intended to provide a quick overview of the systemâ€™s CPU structure
to assist with performance tuning or parallel resource allocation.

Note:
    Reported values may not always be accurate due to system configuration,
    virtualization, or limited hardware visibility.
